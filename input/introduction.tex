\noindent Ripple is real-time gross settlement system (RTGS), currency exchange by Ripple. It is also called the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol. It is built upon a distributed open source Internet protocol, ledger and  cryptocurrency called XRP (ripples). Ripple enables, Secure, fast, instant and free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks. The digital currency XRP acts as a bridge currency to other currencies. It supports tokens that represents fiat currency, cryptocurrency. It is based around a shared, public database which uses a process that allows for payments, exchanges and remittance in a distributed process. It is fastest and most scalable Digital Asset in the world. Ripple is a very popular network as many banks across the world use it as the basis for their own settlement. \\

\noindent Ripple is a technology that acts as both a cryptocurrency and a digital payment network for financial transactions. It was first developed in 2004 by Ryan Fugger, a  web developer in Vancouver, British Columbia. Fugger conceived of the idea after working on a local exchange trading system in Vancouver with his intent to create a decentralized monetary system that effectively allow individuals and communities to create their own money. This led to the conception of a new system by Jed McCaleb of eDonkey network, which was designed and built by Arthur Britto and David Schwartz In May 2011, the development of a digital currency system begins in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by bitcoin, which relies on blockchain ledgers This new version of the Ripple system was designed to eliminate bitcoin's reliance on centralized exchanges, It use less electricity than bitcoin and perform transactions much more quickly than bitcoin. Chris Larsen founded the lending services companies E-Loan and prosper, joined the team in August 2012  and together McCaleb and Larsen approached Ryan Fugger with their digital currency idea. In September 2012 the team co-founded the corporation OpenCoin, or OpenCoin Inc. launched Ripple. \\ 



\section{Problem analysis}

We utilize it for predicting real-valued quantity, the price of Ripple. Based on
this  price  prediction  method,  we  devise  a  simple
strategy for trading Ripple. The strategy is able
to nearly double the investment in less than 60 day
period when run against real data trace.


\section{Objectives of the Project}
The  goal of this project is to find out what exactly cryptocurrency, such as Ripple, is and why it has value, what its future outlook is and if it could become the mainstream currency of the future. 
Ripple is a fully decentralized currency. It has value because its supply is limited 
and  there  is  demand  for  its  low  transaction  costs,  anonymity,  investment  possibilities  and 
possibilities for use in illegal activities. Its future outlook is questionable as Ripple has a few severe disadvantages such as high price volatility, susceptibility to hacking, no protection from a central bank and no consumer protection. It is therefore unlikely that it will catch on as an established  currency  to  the  general  public,  as  its  two  main  strengths,  anonymity  and  low 
transaction  costs  are  not  necessarily  what  the  average  consumer  demands. 
However  the technology behind  cryptocurrency  and  Ripple can  be  applied  to  other  currency  or  payment systems which could have a lasting impact on how people spend money in the future.
