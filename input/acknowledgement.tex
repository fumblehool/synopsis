We, students of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana, have taken efforts in this project.
However, it would not have been possible without the kind support and help of many individuals
and organizations. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all of them.

The authors are highly grateful to Dr. M.S. Saini Director, Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana for providing them with the opportunity to carry out their Major project.

The author would like to wholeheartedly thank Amanpreet Singh Brar, Associate Professor, at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana who is a vast sea of knowledge and
without whose constant and never ending support and motivation, it would never have been
possible to complete the project and other assignments so efficiently and effectively.

Finally, we would like to thank our mentors at OpenSCAD organization Marius Kintel and Torsten Paul. Without their encouragement and Guidence, it would not have been possible to complete this project
in such an efficient manner.
